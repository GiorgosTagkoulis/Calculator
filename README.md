# Callback Calculator

A calculator, with the following functionality:

**`calculator.add(2, 2, callback);`**
The callback should be called with: 4

**`calculator.subtract(4, 2, callback);`**
The callback should be called with: 2

**`calculator.multiply(3, 5, callback);`**
The callback should be called with: 15

**`calculator.divide(45, 15, callback);`**

# Promise calculator
